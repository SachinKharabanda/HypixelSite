            <img src="/images/skyblock.png" alt="skyblock-image">
            <p>Hypixel SkyBlock is one of the most popular and in-depth game modes on the Hypixel network. It expands on traditional Skyblock by adding RPG-style progression, custom items, skills, dungeons, bosses, and a large player-driven economy. Players progress through multiple islands and regions, upgrade their gear, and complete quests, making it a long-term, progression-focused experience rather than a simple survival challenge.</p>
